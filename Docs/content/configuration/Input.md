## Setting up controllers ##

For each player, select the device you want to use.  To connect more than 2 controllers, select the `Super Multitap` controller, which will display 4 additional controller configuration dropdowns.
To setup the key mappings for a controller (or other device-specific options), click the `Setup` button on the right of the player you want to configure.

## Configuring Key Bindings ##

</div></div>

Each player can have up to four tabs of key bindings -- this allows you to control the same player with different input devices.  For example, you can setup player 1 to be controlled by your keyboard and your Xbox controller at the same time.

To select a binding for a button, click on the corresponding button in the UI and then press the key or gamepad button you want to use for this button.  
To clear a binding, click on it and then close the popup window by clicking on the X button.  
To clear all bindings for this tab, click on the `Clear Key Bindings`.

To simplify configuration, a number of presets are available -- click on the `Select Preset` button to choose one.

You can also configure that controller's turbo buttons' speed with the `Turbo Speed` slider. *Note: setting the turbo speed to the fastest setting may cause some games to not detect the button presses at all.*

## Super Scope ##

The mouse is used to simulate the Super Scope's buttons:

* **Fire**: Left Button
* **Turbo**: Right Button
* **Cursor**: Middle Button

## Advanced Options ##

**Controller axis deadzone size**: Controls the deadzone size for analog sticks. A larger deadzone means that the analog stick will need to be moved more before a button press is registered.

### Display Controller Input ###
